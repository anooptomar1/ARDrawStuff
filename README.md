# ARDrawStuff
You should be able to use this app to draw things on flat surfaces.

This app was created initially using Apple's ARKitExample. Those files were then modified according to the tutorial at:

I am making further modifications to the app in order to gain an understanding of working with graphics libraries and ARKit.
